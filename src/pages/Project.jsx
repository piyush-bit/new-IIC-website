    { title: "Portable Soil Monitoring System", description: "The project will benefit farmers by letting them know the amount of minerals present in the soil. As now-a-days farmers don’t know what is the composition of minerals in their soil, they put fertilizers in a haphazard manner. So we use the spectroscopy technology to know the composition of minerals present in the soil, thus allowing them use fertilizers in a well planned manner that will enhance the quality of soil. We made a sample solution of soil to be tested, and then we placed it in between two convex lenses. The source of light ray is an LED bulb that illuminates and thus producing light rays. The light rays after passing through the convex lens converges at other end, i.e. at camera thus allowing to know the intensity and hence composition of minerals.", image: "/images/soil.jpg" },

Then the wastewater goes under osmosis with the charcoal treated tap water resulting in a decrease in impurity concentration of the wastewater. After this water undergoes RO with pure water to obtain pure water. And again the wastewater undergoes the previously mentioned cyclic process which causes the zero wastage of water.", image: "/images/ro.jpg" },
